	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF) steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels, and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguards-by-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel cycle fidelity.},

  abstract = { Fuel depletion is an important aspect of fuel cycle modeling, allowing a user to account for how loaded fuel compositions affect in-core and spent fuel compositions and their related fuel cycle metrics. Therefore, multiple methods have been developed to account for depletion within fuel cycle simulations. This work adds to that list of methods by introducing an open-source coupling between Cyclus and OpenMC to perform fuel depletion during a fuel cycle simulation, called OpenMCyclus. This work explains the methodology of OpenMCyclus and presents a benchmark comparison between the performance of OpenMCyclus and another Cyclus archetype that uses recipes to define spent fuel compositions. The development of this coupling expands the functionalities possible through Cyclus by providing real-time fuel depletion that is reactor agnostic and open source. }

To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

In order to address some perceived drawbacks of these methods, we have developed a new method for solving multiphysics transient calculations using the Predictor-Corrector Quasi-Static method. Our method involves computing reactivity feedback parameters during each transport timestep in order to enable reactivity feedback on the small timescale used by the point kinetics phase of the calculation. The advantage of this approach is that the transport solver does not need to store local ﬂux information between time steps, potentially making it more appropriate for use with a Monte Carlo solver. We have demonstrated the accuracy of our method by solving a simple model problem that exhibits difﬁcult multiphysics behavior. Additionally, we have compared our results against another recently published multiphysics coupling scheme, conﬁrming that our approach does not negatively affect the accuracy of the transient solution.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the stability of xenon oscillations is estimated by solution of the time-dependent neutron diffusion equation, coupled with iodine and xenon equations, by finding out the damping ratios in each case. This is performed for different initial perturbations and core burnup conditions and is a very time- consuming and tedious process. Some earlier studies include linear stability estimation, which is valid for small perturbations, but not much work has been done in nonlinear stability analysis for spatial xenon oscillations in particular. In this paper, an approach for carrying out bifurcation analysis of xenon oscillations in large pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) is demonstrated using reduced-order models. The reduced-order model for studying spatial xenon oscillations consists of multipoint kinetic equations coupled with xenon and iodine equations along with explicit fuel and coolant temperature feedback. Both subcritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in different parameter planes exist, which leads to unstable limit cycles in the linearly stable region (subcritical Hopf bifurcation) and stable limit cycles in the linearly unstable region (supercritical Hopf bifurcation). The stability map provides a total picture of the stability of the out-of-phase oscillations in a PHWR. Depending on the value of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity and coolant temperature coefficient of reactivity, one can determine the operating power level above which the out-of-phase xenon oscillations start to grow. This model can be used to analyze nonlinear stability characteristics without spatial power control, which is helpful in identification of stable/unstable regimes in different parameter spaces and is likely to aid in reactor design.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

	abstract = {The ability to perform sensitivity analysis has been enabled for the nuclear fuel cycle simulator DYMOND through its coupling with the design and analysis toolkit Dakota. To test and demonstrate these new capabilities, a transition scenario and multi-parameter study were devised. The transition scenario represents a partial transition from the US nuclear fleet to a closed fuel cycle with small modular LWRs and fast reactors fueled by reprocessed used nuclear fuel. Four uncertain parameters in this transition were studied – start date of reprocessing, total reprocessing capacity, the nuclear energy demand growth, and the rate at which the fast reactors are deployed – with respect to their impact on four response metrics. The responses – total natural uranium consumed, maximum annual enrichment capacity required, total disposed mass, and total cost of the nuclear fuel cycle – were chosen based on measures known to be of interest in transition scenarios [] and to be significantly impacted by the varying parameters. Analysis of this study was performed both from the direct sampling and through surrogate models developed in Dakota to calculate the global sensitivity measures Sobol’ indices. This example application of this new capability showed that the most consequential parameter to most metrics was the share of new build capacity that is fast reactors. However, for the cost metric, the scaling factor of the energy demand growth was significant and had synergistic behavior with the fast reactor new build share.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	title = {Investigation of the impacts of deploying reactors fueled by high-assay low enriched uranium},

	abstract = {The United States is considering the deployment of advanced reactors that require uranium enriched between 5-20\% 235U, often referred to as High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). At the present, there are no commercial facilities in the US to produce HALEU, prompting questions of how to create a dependable supply chain of HALEU to support these reactors. HALEU can be produced through two primary methods: downblending High Enriched Uranium (HEU) and enriching natural uranium. The amount of HEU available and impurities present in the HEU limit downblending capabilities. The Separative Work Unit (SWU) capacity and amount of natural uranium available limit enriching natural uranium capabilities. To understand the resources necessary to commercially produce HALEU with each of these methods, one can quantify the material requirements of transitioning to HALEU-fueled reactors.

In this dissertation, we model the transition from Light Water Reactors to different advanced reactors, considering once-through and closed fuel cycles to determine material requirements for supporting these fuel cycles. Material requirements of interest across this work include the mass of enriched uranium, mass of HALEU, feed uranium, SWU capacity, and the mass of used fuel sent for disposal. We use CYCLUS and publicly-available information about Light Water Reactors, the X-energy Xe-100, the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor, and the NuScale VOYGR to model potential transition scenarios and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. To more accurately model the closed fuel cycles, we develop a new CYCLUS archetype, called OpenMCyclus, that couples with OpenMC to dynamically model fuel depletion in a reactor and provide more accurate used fuel compositions. The results of this transition analysis show how the characteristics of the advanced reactors deployed drive the materials required to support the fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle reduces the materials required, but the reduction in materials is driven by the amount of material available for reprocessing.

To gain more insight into how transition parameters not considered in the transition analysis affect material requirements, we perform sensitivity analysis on one of the once-through transitions by coupling CYCLUS with Dakota. The results of the sensitivity analysis highlight some of the trade-offs between different reactor designs. One such tradeoff is the increased HALEU demand but decreased used fuel discharged when increasing the Xe-100 deployment and decreasing the VOYGR deployment. Additionally, these results identify the Xe-100 discharge burnup as consistently being one of the most impactful input parameters for this transition, because of how the deployment scheme in this work affects the number of Xe-100s built no matter which advanced reactor build share is specified.

To identify potential transitions that minimize material requirements, we then use the CYCLUS-Dakota to optimize a once-through transition using the genetic algorithms in Dakota. In single-objective problems to minimize the SWU capacity required to produce HALEU and minimize the amount of used nuclear fuel, the algorithm finds solutions that are consistent with the results of the sensitivity analysis. The results cannot be taken at face value, because the algorithm did not fully converge and the genetic algorithms do not enforce the applied linear constraint for the advanced reactor build shares to sum to 100\%. However, the results provide guidance on how to adjust the input parameters to optimize the transition for a minimal HALEU SWU or the used fuel mass. Parameter adjustments include maximizing the number of Light Water Reactors that receive license extensions to operate for 80 years. Similar results occur when using this method for a multi-objective problem to minimize both the HALEU SWU capacity and the used fuel mass.

Finally, we use neutronics models of the Xe-100 and Micro Modular Reactor reactor designs to evaluate the steady-state reactor physics performance of downblended HEU in these two designs. We compare the performance of the downblended HEU to nominally enriched fuel, based on the k-eff, βeff, energy- and spatially-dependent neutron fluxes, as well as the fuel, moderator, coolant, and total reactivity temperature feedback coefficients. The differences in the fuel compositions leads to differences in each of the metrics. However, these differences are within error of the results of the nominally enriched fuel, or would not prevent the reactor from meeting stated design specifications or operating in a safe state.

The work completed in this dissertation develops and demonstrates a methodology for modeling fuel cycle transitions and understanding the effects of deploying HALEU-fueled reactors in the US. The effects investigated in these example scenarios include various materials and resources required to support these reactors, and how the parameters of the transition affect these requirements. The information generated from this new methodology can be used to develop the necessary infrastructure and supply chains for support a transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. Furthermore, this work explores how the HALEU production method (enriching compared with downblending) affects reactor performance.},

	abstract = {Is an energy transition currently in progress, where renewable energy sources are replacing fossil fuels? Previous changes in the proportion of energy produced by various sources – such as in the nineteenth century when coal surpassed biomass in providing the largest share of the global energy supply and in the twentieth century when petroleum overtook coal – could more accurately be characterized as energy additions rather than transitions. In both cases, the use of the older energy source continued to grow, despite rapid growth in the new source. Evidence from contemporary trends in energy production likewise suggest that as renewable energy sources compose a larger share of overall energy production, they are not replacing fossil fuels but are rather expanding the overall amount of energy that is produced. We argue that although it is reasonable to expect that renewables will come to provide a growing share of the global energy supply, it is misleading to characterize this growth in renewable energy as a “transition” and that doing so could inhibit the implementation of meaningful policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel use.},

As numerous scholars have argued, an energy transition away from – rather than in addition to – fossil fuels will require more than technology and financial capital. Here we argue that a feminist perspective on energy provides an important framework for understanding what keeps us stuck in unsustainable energy cultures, as well as a paradigm for designing truly just energy systems. Feminist approaches have been widely taken up in environmental and ecofeminist work, as well as in climate change research. In energy studies, however, gender-related research has tended to focus more narrowly on women's issues. Although this is crucial work, the focus on women represents just one dimension of what feminism can bring to the study of energy. Feminist theory also offers expertise in the study of power more broadly, which is widely applicable to the full spectrum of energy research. This article outlines a feminist energy research agenda that addresses many aspects of energy system design, planning, exchange, and use. We analyze energy along four intersecting coordinates: the political (democratic, decentralized and pluralist); economic (prioritizing human well-being and biodiversity over profit and unlimited growth); socio-ecological (preferring relationality over individualism); and technological (privileging distributed and decentralized fuel power and people power). In doing so, we show that feminism is well-suited for navigating the tangled web of power, profit, and technological innovation that comprises human fuel use.},

Currently, established uranium mining methods encompass open-pit mining, underground mining, and in situ leaching (ISL). Notably, in situ leaching stands out due to its environmental friendliness, efficient extraction, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, it unlocks the potential of extracting uranium from previously challenging low-grade sandstone-hosted deposits, presenting novel opportunities for uranium mining.

The local mode analysis of selected uranium nitrides, N≡U≡N, U≡N, N≡U=NH and N≡U=O, could confirm and quantify, for the first time, that these molecules exhibit a UN triple bond as hypothesized in the literature. We hope that this review will inspire the community interested in uranium chemistry and will serve as an incubator for fruitful collaborations between theory and experimentation in exploring the wealth of uranium chemistry.},

This work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios using Cyclus to compare how the type of the advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the material requirements of the transition to High Assay Low Enriched Uranium-fueled reactors. Fuel cycle scenarios considered include the current fleet of Light Water Reactors in the U.S. as well as a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor or the X-energy Xe-100 reactor from the current fleet of U.S. Light Water Reactors. This work explored parameters of interest including the number of advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition. Fueling Xe-100 reactors requires less enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity than fueling Light Water Reactors before the transition.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation.

	abstract = {This report is focused on the effects of climate changes on the chemical composition
of deep groundwaters The aim of the work has been to assess the hydrochemical stability
at nuclear repository sites in Finland and Sweden Sites investigated by SKB and POSIVA
have been compared The corresponding features are important in judging how sensitive
a site might be to climatic changes Evidence for climate effects in the past on groundwater
compositions has been reviewed, including isotopic and mineralogical data There is
for example evidence that glacial meltwaters are currently present at repository depths
in the Fennoscandian Shield No evidence has been found however that oxidising conditions
have ever prevailed at depth, even if glacial meltwaters presumably had a substantial
amount of dissolved 02 The depth distribution of different calcite types (and other
fracture minerals) indicates stability in large-scale groundwater circulation over
time Information on past (and future) groundwater salinities has been sought after
in the results of hydrological numerical models for Aespoe in Sweden and Olkiluoto
in Finland It is expected that groundwater salinities will change due to future climatic
variations The main effects will be from shoreline movements, permafrost and continental
ice-sheets In most sites the present reducing redox conditions will remain undisturbed
during glacial cycles The modelling indicated that most of the SKB suitability criteria
will be met during the life-span of the repository and the groundwater composition
will vary within what is observed in the samples collected today at various depths
The expected changes are therefore not judged to threaten the integrity and functioning
of the repository The major conclusion is that despite long-term hydrodynamic changes
hydrochemical stability is expected to dominate at repository depth (orig)},

	abstract = {Many countries worldwide are investigating the use of advanced fuels and fuel cycles
for purposes such as increasing the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle, or decreasing
the radiological impact of used fuel One common metric used to assess the radiological
impact to humans of fuels placed in a repository is the total radiotoxicity of the
fuel, but this approach does not take into account how engineered and natural (ie
rock) barriers can remove many radiotoxic nuclides from ground water before they reach
the surface In this study we evaluate the radiotoxicity of advanced fuels in the context
of a full repository simulation Heavy water moderated reactors, such as the CANDU®
reactor, are well-suited to the use of advanced fuels, and the post-closure performance
of a deep geological repository for spent natural uranium fuel from them has already
been studied For this study, two advanced fuels of current interest were chosen: a
TRUMOX fuel designed to recycle plutonium and minor actinides and thereby reduce the
amount of these materials going into disposal, and a plutonium-thorium-based fuel
whose main goal is to increase sustainability by reducing uranium consumption The
impact of filling a deep geological repository, of identical design to that for natural
uranium, with used fuel from these fuel cycles was analyzed It was found that the
two advanced fuels analyzed had dose rates, to a critical group of humans living above
the repository, which remained a factor of 170 to 340 lower than the current acceptance
limit for releases, while being 53 (for TRUMOX) and 26 (for thorium-plutonium) times
higher than those of natural uranium When the dose rates are normalized to total energy
produced, the repository emissions are comparable In this case, the maximum dose rates
were found to be 6\% lower for the TRUMOX fuel, and 16\% higher for the plutonium-thorium
fuel, than for the used natural uranium fuel (author)},

The options for carbon emission reductions are grouped into (1) generation of secondary energy carriers, (2) end-use energy sectors and (3) sector interdependencies. The challenges on the way to a decarbonized energy sector are identified with respect to environmental sustainability, security of energy supply, economic stability and social aspects. A global carbon tax is the most promising instrument to accelerate the process of decarbonization. Nevertheless, this process will be very challenging for humanity due to high capital requirements, the competition among energy sectors for decarbonization options, inconsistent environmental policies and public acceptance of changes in energy use.},

This article presents a systematic literature review covering the main ESOMs, the input and output data involved, the trends in scenario analysis for decarbonization pathways in national economies, and the challenges associated with energy system optimization modelling. The first part introduces the characterization of ESOMs, showing a trend in modelling focused on long-term, multisector, multiperiod, bottom-up, linear programming, and perfect foresight. Secondly, the analysis shows the intensive data requirements, including future demand profiles, fuel price projections, energy potentials, and techno-economic characteristics of technologies. This review also reveals that decarbonization pathways are the principal objective in energy system optimization modelling, including key drivers such as high-share renewable energy integration, energy efficiency increase, sector coupling, and sustainable transport. The last section presents ten challenges and their corresponding opportunities in research, highlighting the improvement of spatiotemporal resolution, transparency, the inclusion of social aspects, the representation of developing country features, and quality and availability data.},

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.},

	abstract = {Coated particle fuel concepts date back some 60 years, and have evolved significantly from the relatively primitive pyrocarbon-coated kernels envisioned by the first pioneers. Improvements in particle design, coating layer properties, and kernel composition have produced the modern tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle, capable of low statistical coating failure fractions and good fission product retention under extremely severe conditions, including temperatures of 1600 °C for hundreds of hours. The fuel constitutes one of the key enabling technologies for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, allowing coolant outlet temperatures approaching 1000 °C and contributing to enhanced reactor safety due to the hardiness of the particles. TRISO fuel development has taken place in a number of countries worldwide, and several fuel qualification programs are currently in progress. In this paper, we discuss the unique history of particle fuel development and some key technology advances, concluding with some of the latest progress in UO2 and UCO TRISO fuel qualification.},

	abstract = {The lineage of the Dragon Project can be traced back to 1955 when the United Kingdom launched a nuclear power programme which involved the construction of large graphite moderated reactors fuelled with natural uranium and cooled by carbon dioxide. Not long afterwards the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) of the then newly formed Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), in the spirit of the time, sought to encourage the construction of nuclear power stations and the development of joint nuclear undertakings. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) had, since 1949, been studying possible long term improvements in energy conversion efficiency resulting from higher coolant gas temperatures and the use of ceramic materials. A 1955 paper on gas-cooled reactors using the U-233/thorium cycle attracted interest and this progressed to the definition of an initial programme. The high temperature work led to a proposal for a 20MW(Th) Reactor Experiment and one important consequence of the ENEA/OEEC initiative was the setting up in April 1959 of the international Dragon Project Agreement. Initial experiments at Harwell in 1957 had involved the coating of small spheroidal particles of uranium carbide or oxide with pyrolytic carbon which were then bonded with carbonaceous material. But experiments demonstrated that fission products such as caesium, strontium or barium could diffuse through such coatings. This led in 1961 to the modification of the coated particle design by the addition of an intermediate layer of silicon or zirconium carbide. The small size of the particles necessitated a statistical approach to quality during manufacture and effort was concentrated on the minimisation of the broken or defective particle fraction. The subsequent operation of the Dragon Reactor for over 10 years confirmed the benign nature of a HTR. It also proved that fuel bodies made with coated particles were capable of maintaining a high degree of fission product containment at high temperatures and for high burn-ups. What is remarkable is the speed with which the particle design evolved. The success of the choices that were made resulted in the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries. Irrespective of the particular core design, the basic component of HTR fuel is the coated particle. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised worldwide that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors. They enable more efficient use of fissile isotopes as well as providing inherent reactor safety. Unlike most other reactor designs, the HTR can take economic advantage from operation at high gas outlet temperatures, whilst maintaining the good retention of fuel and fission products within the fuel elements. The fuel cycle can use uranium, thorium or plutonium. In addition the burn-up can be high, permitting safe disposal of spent fuel without the need for reprocessing. Fast reactors based on coated particle fuel may be a future possibility. The Dragon Project was a successful political collaboration and a technical triumph in demonstrating a new type of reactor. However, overstretched resources coupled with a world-wide trend in that era to favour water reactors caused work on Dragon to be terminated in March 1976. By then the main objectives for the Dragon Project had been successfully achieved and extensively reported. The progression from the 20MWE(Th) Dragon to a 1200MW(e) power station as a single jump in technology was too large a step for the time. The experiences of the other major civil HTR projects of the same period in Germany and the United States of America resulted in the high temperature reactor system being studied in its various forms by many countries as is evidenced by the large number of papers presented at the biennial HTR conferences. In the intervening years since the early HTRs were launched it has been realised that there are now even more factors favouring the use of high temperature reactors.},

	abstract = {Pebble-bed High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) designs present a unique modeling challenge. Pebble-
bed reactors can have a variety of pebble compositions due to varying levels of burnup. In addition, the pebbles
are mobile in the core — entering from the top and exiting through the bottom — and may fall in a haphazard
arrangement. This work introduces a 20 MWth pebble-bed HTGR reactor design (which will be referred to as
Sangamon20) that is representative of current pebble bed reactors, and investigates not only the neutronics of the
base model, but the changes to core neutronics after making modifications to the simulation. These modifications
include: heterogenous versus homogenous pebble centers, imposing a universal symmetry assumption, and
changing the arrangement of pebble fuel compositions, using Serpent and Python. This is in support of the ultimate
goal of this project: to establish a baseline source term and to determine what simplifications, if any, can be made in
the model to strike a balance between computational cost and precision of the results. This is crucial for any future
licensing effort, safety analysis, or accident analysis involving pebble-bed reactors. The model of Sangamon20
uses a random dispersal of seven different pebble compositions, each corresponding to a different burnup level.
The heterogeneous tests compare ke f f ; thermal and fast flux profiles; and the neutron lethargy-adjusted energy
spectra in the core, reflector, coolant, a random fresh, and a random discharge-burnup pebble. Shuffling and
symmetry tests monitor changes to ke f f and the outgoing neutron current at the outer reflector boundary; the
former because it is an important reactor physics parameter, and the latter because it can be used to find the
anticipated neutron flux the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) would experience. This informs the level of radiation
damage one could expect the RPV to experience each year - which is useful from a design and safety perspective.
Neither the symmetry test nor the shuffling test showed a major difference in either the ke f f or the outward neutron
current at the outer edge of the reflector. This would suggest that there is no need to simulate all possible pebble
placements to characterize a reactor. However, for the heterogeneous tests, ke f f differed by 4.45\%, and the pebble
spectra at certain higher energies disagreed by a factor of 2-4. A complete fuel isotopic composition at each burnup
step is accessible at [37]. This thesis discusses select isotopic inventories of interest. These can be used to inform
source term determination or spent fuel compositions.},

Initially, a 24-month two-batch fuel management scheme was developed, targeting an equilibrium cycle Burnup (BU) of 26 GWD/MTU. The scheme required a maximum of ∼550 ppm Critical Boron Concentration (CBC) in the early cycle BU. Analysis of radial and axial power profiles revealed that the power peaking factors remained within acceptable limits, with values not exceeding 1.4 and 1.6 throughout the cycle, respectively. Subsequently, various Daily Load-Follow Operation (DLFO) scenarios were examined at different BU levels. These investigations demonstrated a consistent alignment between the demanded power and the reactor's power output. Furthermore, critical safety parameters, including the Axial Shape Index (ASI) and inlet coolant temperature, consistently remained within prescribed design specifications. The study's findings underscore the feasibility and reliability of implementing a VLSB APR1400 core with LEU + fuel, using mode-K+ and advanced fuel management strategies for effective power generation and safety compliance. To perform the analysis, an in-house diffusion code KANT was utilized, KANT is based on NEM-CMFD accelerated simulation tool, while the cross-section was generated via Serpent 2.2.0 assessed with ENDF VII.B data library.}

abstract = {To improve fuel cycle performance and economics, commercial light water reactor operators and fuel suppliers are pursuing evolutionary changes to nuclear fuel that include the use of extended low enrichment fuel (LEU + ). In this paper, the integral design of a 24-month equilibrium cycle of a 2317 MWth / 803 MWe boiling water reactor (BWR) was obtained using LEU + . The starting point was to determine the fuel batch fraction, average enrichment, and discharge burnup, through linear reactivity model and CASMO4 simulations. Subsequently, the design and optimization of the fuel bundle was carried out with a Multi-state Recurrent Neural Network. Once the fuel bundle was designed, and starting from an operating cycle of 18 months, the reloading pattern was designed for several cycles until obtaining the equilibrium cycle of 24 months, using the Tabu Search metaheuristic optimization technique and Haling simulations. Furthermore, the control rod pattern for the obtained equilibrium cycle was designed with a system based on the Tabu Search metaheuristic technique to verify that the target cycle length of 17.011 MWd/kgU was reached and that the main thermal limits: MFLPD, MAPRAT and MFCHFR were not exceeded during reactor operation. Finally, the levelized nuclear fuel cycle cost (LNFCC) of the open fuel cycle was calculated and compared with that of the 18-month cycle. The results show that the 24-month operating cycle using LEU + is feasible for the studied BWR under the main steady-state safety operating limits and with a lower levelized cost for the open fuel cycle compared to that of the 18-month cycle estimated at 7 % for the entire fuel cycle and 25.6 % for the back-end phase. Moreover, two sensitivity studies were conducted, one related to the discount rate and the other to the unit price of the enrichment separative work unit. The result is that the LNFCC difference between the 18-month and the 24-month cycles decreases as the discount rate increases, and as expected, the effect of SWU price change is presented only in the front-end, and the LNFCC increases as the SWU unit price increases, with the increase being 18.9 % higher for the 24-month cycle and 17.1 % higher for the 18-month cycle.}

  annote       = {The use of increased fuel enrichment, which is still in the realm of low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, has been of interest to commercial light water reactor operators as part of the next iteration in fuel cycle technological advances and research and development. Using increased enrichment fuel, or high-assay LEU (HALEU), in power plants has clear benefits for being able to load cores with additional power-producing fuel. Although HALEU enrichments can range up to 20%, the more guarded approach of investigating enrichments above current fuels within 10% enrichment is referred to as LEU plus (LEU+) to reflect the less drastic change in operating conditions and requirements and similarity to current fuel cycles. Of additional interest and increasing maturity is the incorporation of accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) concepts, which are also applicable to the current fleet. This class of technologies involves changes such as cladding (e.g., chromium coating or FeCrAl) and fuel composition (e.g., chromia dopant) alterations to demonstrate improved fuel performance under accident scenarios. The ability to properly store fuel before and after residence time in the reactor is crucial to plant operation. Typically, this is done in either a new fuel vault (NFV) or spent fuel pool (SFP). Storing, loading, and unloading dozens of fuel assemblies within the same general area provides opportunities for obvious criticality concerns. These concerns are addressed with regulations to the subcriticality margin that the NFV and SFP must maintain in certain conditions. Adopting LEU+ fuel results in inherent reactivity increases, which are extremely relevant for safe fuel storage. Therefore, a clear understanding of the effects of LEU+ fuel and ATF on criticality safety margins to regulatory limits is required, as well as an understanding of the degree of absorber crediting under normal and accident conditions.},
